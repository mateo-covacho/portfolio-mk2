      <h3>Challenges building this project</h3>
      <p>
        The challenges of this project where dividded in two parts: <br />
        <br />
        First was dealing with the visual design process. Since this was going to be the first this about me, most people saw it was obviously very
        important for it to look good. This presented some challenges when I developed a feeling that there was always a visual problem, even tho
        there were none. I fixed this by redesigning the site multiple times and taking inspiration from other developer's portfolios. <br />
        <br />A different challenge came when dealing with three JS. I ended up not using it for this site since it kept giving me much more trouble
        Then it was word and made everything a problem to deal with.
