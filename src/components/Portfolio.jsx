        As a software engineer, I developed a simple frontend project to showcase my skills and abilities. One of the main challenges I faced was with
        the visual design process. I wanted the site to look good, so I spent a lot of time redesigning it and taking inspiration from other
        developer's portfolios. Despite my efforts, I often felt that there were visual problems with the site, even when there weren't any.
        Eventually, I was able to overcome this challenge by constantly iterating and refining the design.

        Another challenge I encountered was when I tried to use three JS. It caused a lot of issues and made everything difficult, so I decided not to
        use it in this project. Instead, I focused on using more straightforward technologies that allowed me to build the site quickly and
        efficiently.

        Despite these challenges, I was able to complete the project and create a portfolio that effectively showcases my skills as a software
        engineer. However, the most important part of building this web portfolio was not just about how it looked, but also how it functioned. I
        wanted to ensure that the site had a smooth navigation process and was easy for users to interact with. To achieve this, I spent a lot of time
        testing and debugging the site, making sure that all the links worked correctly and that the overall user experience was seamless.
      </p>

        In the end, I was very pleased with the outcome of this project. Not only did it allow me to demonstrate my skills as a software engineer, but
        it also gave me valuable experience in dealing with the challenges that can arise during the development process. I learned a lot from this
        project and am confident that it will help me in my future endeavors as a software engineer.
