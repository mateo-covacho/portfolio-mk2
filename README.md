# Personal portfolio mk2
This is a simple frontend project that like I developed to help me expose my abilities as a software engineer.

## Challenges building this project
The challenges of this project were divided in two parts:

First was dealing with the visual design process. Since this was going to be the first this about me, most people saw it was obviously very important for it to look good. This presented some challenges when I developed a feeling that there was always a visual problem, even tho there were none. I fixed this by redesigning the site multiple times and taking inspiration from other developer's portfolios.

A different challenge came when dealing with three JS. I ended up not using it for this site since it kept giving me much more trouble than it was word and made everything a problem to deal with.
